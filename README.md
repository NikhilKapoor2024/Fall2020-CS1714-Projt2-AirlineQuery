# Fall2020-CS1714-Projt2-AirlineQuery
This was my second project for CS 1714: Intro to Comp Sci II. The task here was to use FILE* variables and Strings in C to
write a program simulating a menu for airline travel, that would allow the user to search through information on airlines
from either the route, departings, arrivals, or by directly looking up the airline. Edits have been made to avoid copyright
issues and such.
